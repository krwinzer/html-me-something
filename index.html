              This December 31st, we will celebrate 12 years of marriage. We’ve had a great year of learning
              and growing together in the Lord. We’ve been studying together about gender roles in the faith
              through a sermon series called A Beautiful Design. It has been a rich time of coming closer together
              as we learn more about who God designed each of us to be. As we approach 2018, we are anticipating
              several changes in the organization and management of our family.
            </p>

            <p>
              Kelly is attending a unique program called LaunchCode where she is quickly learning to work as a
              professional Software Developer. Over 500 people applied for a spot in this program and only 120
              were accepted. After 6 weeks in the program, 88% of those that began are still in the program.
              LaunchCode is an incredibly exciting opportunity and Kelly feels privileged to be able to attend.
              For years, Kelly has dabbled in teaching herself to code and now a secret passion of hers is coming
              to fruition in ways we never could have imagined. We anticipate that she will begin working as a full-time
              developer here in Kansas City sometime next year. In addition, she is currently being considered for the
              position of Co-Director for a program called Coding & Cocktails. The program is run by Kansas City Women
              in Technology and provides a unique opportunity for women with an interest in development to explore
              technology through a monthly gathering where a specific topic is discussed and practiced while enjoying
              good food and great cocktails. Kelly is also active in our church, Grace Family Fellowship, as a
              children’s ministry volunteer. She is still busy caring for our family and helping to homeschool our
              children. In her free time, she spends quality time with her close friends and loves to craft all sorts of things.

                Nathan has taken on many of the tasks of managing our household as he transitions to overseeing all
                that happens here at home. He is learning the routine of homeschooling the children on the days they
                are not at Discovery Homeschool Academy. He is committed to his continued healing and attends many
                appointments at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center throughout the week. He enjoys buying and selling
                on Craigslist and Ebay and our mailman, Randy, greatly appreciates his many contributions to the daily
                mail. In his free time, he hangs with his buddies and enjoys watching baseball and football as well as
                working on his woodworking.

              Paxton turned 8 in September and is in the 2nd grade. He attends Discovery Homeschool Academy and is
              enjoying the school setting and making new friends. He is so smart and inventive which sometimes means
              he gets in trouble for taking everything apart! He loves to explore and discover things in nature and
              is passionate about conservation efforts for endangered species. When he’s at home, you’ll never see
              him without his poodle, Buster. They are quite the pair! He loves Buster and frequently tries to train
              him to do various tricks. Paxton swam for our neighborhood swim team this summer and earned his first
              ribbon at a swim meet. He loves being in the pool and is looking forward to the 2018 swim seasn.Right now,
              he is excited about Power Rangers and Pokemon and he loves to watch nature and science shows on tv.
              He continues to amaze us with how much knowledge he has about the subjects
              he is passionate about. Paxton loves the Lord and loves to tell others about Jesus wherever he goes. He is
              learning a lot through memorizing God’s word at AWANA and The New City Catechism that we are memorizing
              together as a family. We love to watch Paxton learn and grow in the Lord and in his passions.

            <p>
              MacArthur turned 6 at the beginning of 2017 and is very much looking forward to his 7th birthday coming
              up in January. He is also attending Discovery Homeschool Academy and is in the 1st grade. He was quite
              nervous about being away from Mom at the beginning of the year, but he has overcome his fear and is
              doing beautifully in school. He loves his teacher and is enjoying making friends. His current interests
              include crafting with Mom and exploring the outdoors. When the weather is nice, he loves to go fishing
              at the ponds near our house. MacArthur enjoyed being on our neighborhood swim team this summer and is looking
              forward to the 2018 swim season. MacArthur is also attending AWANA and memorizing scriptures. He LOVES to go
              to AWANA and asks us about it lots of times throughout the week. He is doing very well with The New City
              Catechism and is always the first one to raise his hand to answer our nightly review questions. MacArthur’s
              smile lights up our days and we enjoy his mischievous personality.

            <p>
              Sullivan turned 5 in June and had a big dinosaur themed birthday party with a visit from a real t-rex
              (Nathan in a costume)! He is also attending Discovery Homeschool Academy and is in Kindergarten. He is
              quite the popular guy and has many friends in his class. He loves to talk with and learn about other
              people and is very engaging. Sully is our curious guy and we have now lost him at nearly every exciting
              place we’ve gone including a very eventful trip to Kauffman Stadium to see the Royals play. We have to
              work together as a whole team to make sure we keep track of Sullivan when we’re out in public. Sully’s
              current passions are dinosaurs, specifically the Parasarolophus, and outer space, specifically the planet
              Saturn. Sullivan also attends AWANA and is working hard on the New City Catechism. He is so loving and really
              lights up our lives and the lives of our neighbors with his hugs and snuggles and smiles.

            <img src="images\WinzerFamily-2017.07.02-NealDieker-218.jpg" alt="Abbott">
            <p>
              Abbott, who we affectionately call The Badger, is growing leaps and bounds. He is still just 3 years
              old but is wearing the same size clothes as Sullivan and MacArthur. People often think we have triplets
              when these three are out together! Abbott is working hard on potty-training and developing clearer speech.
              He loves playing with his brothers and watching Paw Patrol. His favorite pastime is getting dirty in the
              sandbox followed by snuggles with his Daddy. He goes to the Cubbies class at AWANA and learns about Jesus
              through story and song. He sits with us when we do our Catechism and cheers for his brothers when they get
              the answers right. He is a curious, adventurous, bright-eyed and sweet. He is a bit of a bull in a china
              cabinet with his big size but he keeps going and doesn’t give up on learning to do new things. He is NOT
              a fan of his little sister, Adeline. They have quite the rivalry going and often don’t even want to be in
              the same room. They both adore their Daddy and feel strongly that he belongs to each of them exclusively.
              It is rather entertaining to watch! The Badger keeps our lives interesting and fun!

              We certainly didn’t know what we were getting into when our first baby girl arrived. She turned 2 this
              past June and we are surprised by her daily. She is tenacious and strong-willed. Adeline knows exactly
              what she wants and doesn’t hold back on sharing her opinions even though she doesn’t yet have words.
              She has learned several signs to communicate so she doesn’t get as frustrated. She says ‘Please’ and
              ‘Thank You’ in sign language and Kelly has been working on teaching her to say ‘I Love You’ in sign as well.
              Addie loves all things pink and girly. She also loves getting dirty with her brothers and making a mess
              of her gorgeous curly hair. She can often be found with dirt smeared across her face, food in her hair,
              wearing a frilly pink outfit, directing her brothers to do all sorts of things for her. She is a force to
              be reckoned with and gives Abbott a run for his money. People often say that she’ll be well protected with
              four older brothers. We respond that she can absolutely take care of herself! We recently saw Sullivan
              standing between her and a sweet little boy on the playground. Sully was protecting the little boy! Once we
              figure out how to rein this girl in, she’ll be a powerful force for good!

             Last but not least, Ms. Beatrice. We call her Bea which is pronounced, Bee-ahh. She will be 10 months old in
             December. She is such a sweet baby and loves to watch her siblings run and play. prefers to be held facing out
             so she doesn’t miss any of the action. She is working hard on pushing up to all fours and trying to sit on her
             own. She loves to suck on the last two fingers on her left hand. She gets upset if she can’t get to them and
             sometimes uses her right hand to hold her left hand firmly up to her mouth. She is beginning to hold her own
             bottle and she babbles a LOT. She is quite the chatty girl! We all love her to pieces and she gets more snuggles
             than she knows what to do with. We are excited to watch her grow up to chase whatever dreams God has for her!
